- add man pages for all exported symbols with at least
  the \usage, \arguments  and \examples sections

- look at subListExtract in Biobase and see where it can
  be used to improve speed in AnnotationDbi

- change the map[["titi"]] behaviour so it returns NULL
  if key "titi" is not found in the map (so we align exactly
  with what [[ does with environments)
