- provide some utility to make it easy to look at the schema
  of a given package + in the man page for this utility, mention
  dbListTable and dbListFields and put \code{\link[DBI]{dbListTable}}
  and \code{\link[DBI]{dbListFields}} in the \seealso section

- implement mechanism to check the DBSCHEMAVERSION of a db pkg at
  load time

- add AnnotationDbi.Rnw vignette (main vignette) with more focus on the
  Bimap interface

- fix man page for MAPCOUNTS map in ann db pkg templates +
  in the \examples section, call checkMAPCOUNTS on the db
  package so R CMD check will automatically check this +
  put \code{\link[AnnotationDbi]{checkMAPCOUNTS}} in the
  \seealso section

- merge man pages for ACCNUM or MULTIHIT. In the examples show
  the 3 situations:
    0 hit: agACCNUM[["13290_at"]]; agMULTIHIT[["13290_at"]]
    1 hit: agACCNUM[["12328_at"]]; agMULTIHIT[["12328_at"]]
    multihit: agACCNUM[["15228_s_at"]]; agMULTIHIT[["15228_s_at"]]
  and how to "merge" those 2 maps by converting one of them with
  as(agACCNUM, "AnnDbBimap")

- fix the current INDEX mess (mix of old and new CREATE INDEX
  statements that lead to duplicated indices and an sqlite file
  bigger in size), I think all the old CREATE INDEX statements
  can be removed (they are the same as the new ones) except in
  GO_DB where some useful indices are missing in 0.9

- look at subListExtract in Biobase and see where it can
  be used to improve speed in AnnotationDbi

- pluggable maps
  --------------

  If [to.tablename(x1),to.colname(x1)] (the right table/colname for a direct map,
  the left table/colname for a reverse map) is the same as
  [from.tablename(x2)|from.colname(x2)] (the left table/colname for a direct map,
  the right/colname table for a reverse map), and if inslot.to.keys(x1) and
  inslot.from.keys(x2) are both NAs, then x1 and x2 are "pluggable".
  x <- plugmaps(x1, x2), the result of the "plug" operation, is a map that goes
  from [from.tablename(x1),from.colname(x1)] to [to.tablename(x2)|to.colname(x2)].

  Of course, only maps that belong to the same package will be pluggable
  this way (e.g. hgu95av2PATH2PROBE and hgu95av2ACCNUM, x1 is a reverse
  map and x2 a direct map). So, in fact, something else to check before
  to decide whether x1 and x2 are pluggable is that dbfile(x1) == dbfile(x2).
